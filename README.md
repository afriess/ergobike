# ergobike
Simulation of some Ergo-Bikes for testing GoldenCheetah without need to use a real Bike 

Basic Simulation of a Daum Vita 2002 Ergobike. The code is able to run in Windows, Linux (and Rasbian too). You have to compile the code with Lazarus/FPC, So it is running on all the supported plattforms.

Actual you can change the GEAR and the RPM. The speed is calculated from the formular out of the docs from Daum. See code for more information.
